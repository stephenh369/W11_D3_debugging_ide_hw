1. What is the purpose of a breakpoint?
##### A. To pause the code that is running at a specific point in the code.
2. Does the line of code on a breakpoint run when you start debugging?
##### A. No, It stops before it runs that line of code.
3. How do we debug the next line of code?
##### A. Use the step over or step into options on the ide debugger to move to the next line.
4. What does the step into command do?
##### A. Step into will go into the code being run and stop the code inside the method being called on that line, instead of just running it and moving on like step over.
5. What is the difference between evaluate expression and evaluate code fragment?
##### A. Evaluate code fragment will evaluate multiple lines of code. Evaluate expression is just for evaluation of a single code expression.
